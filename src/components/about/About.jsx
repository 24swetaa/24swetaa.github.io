        <span className='quotes'>Hi, I'm Sweta,</span> pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT (BHU) Varanasi.
An enthusiastic student with a strong affinity for the field of technology, data structures and algorithms, full stack development and machine learning. I have recently done projects in ReactJs, Django, Streamlit, SpringBoot, and Android Studio.
I am passionate about building some interesting applications that will influence the real world for a good cause. I enjoy the time when I am creating any application. This helps me get comfortable with new technologies, databases, and how to handle bugs.
I am interested in working in this field because it is full of challenges, and I will get to learn many skills in this ever-growing tech industry. In today's world, the demand for technology is high and I will be excited to contribute to this field.
